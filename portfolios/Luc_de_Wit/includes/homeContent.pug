    h1 welcome in my programming log book!

    p I am Luke, and i personally really love programming, ive done it scince 2014 (by making terrible batch scripts)

    p this website is meant to be a place where i can share how my life is going how my projects are going what i am learning/have learned.

    p i am currently still in the process of creating this website wich will act like a blog and a portfolio at the same time.

    p in the mean while here is a sneek peek of a code block system i am working on (the syntax highlighting function is partially taken from w3 but I modefied it to do what i want it to do)
                
    p HTML codeblock:

    pre.html
        |&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
        |&lt;html>
        |    &lt;head>
        |       &lt;title>code block example&lt;/title>
        |    &lt;/head>
        |    &lt;body class="test">
        |        &lt;h1 id="wow">wow&lt;/h1> this code block&lt;br>
        |        looks a-MAZE-ing!
        |    &lt;/body>
        |&lt;/html>
