        <p>
           I am Luke, and i personally really love programming, 
          hence why I've done it scince 2014 (by making terrible
          batch scripts) I learned the core concept of batch pretty
          and started to making text based games and learned alot about
          if statements, input/output etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          later, I discorverd HTML, I thought it was sooo cool to make
          my own websites, then i heard about css and javascript and started
          learning those languages so I can make my websites way more 
          impressive
        </p>
        <p>
          then in 2017 it really took off, i learnd about git/github and how
          to work together with other people. I also got into desktop 
          development (Python, c, rust etc)
        </p>
        <p>this is my top 5 programming languages:
          <ul>
            <li>python</li>
            <li>rust</li>
            <li>c</li>
            <li>typescript</li>
            <li>javascript</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
           this website is meant to be a place where i can share how my life 
          is going, how my projects are going and what i am learning/have 
          learned.
